                <h1>Piaget</h1>
                <p>Piaget's model outlines <b>cognitive development.</b>
                Piaget made use of <b>schemas</b>, which he defined to be the unique
                framework with which we organize our concept of the world.
                His model is split into four stages.</p>
                <img alt="Jean Piaget"src="https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/thumbs/jean-piaget-2.jpg">
                <h2>Sensorimotor Stage</h2>
                <p>The sensorimotor stage encompasses the age range of 0-2
                    years. Piaget defined this stage to be the phase when
                    one's way of perceiving the world is primarily via the
                    senses and movement.<br>
                    A prominent aspect of the sensorimotor stage is the lack of
                    object permanence, which is the ability to know that objects
                    still exist without being able to see the object.
                </p>

                <h2>Preoperational Stage</h2>
                <p>The preoperational stage encompasses the age range of 2-6
                    years. Piaget defined this stage to be the phase where
                    children begin to use language to express their schema.<br>
                    At this stage, children gain object permanence. However,
                    they do not understand the concept of conservation. This means
                    that they cannot understand two things to be equivalent
                    despite differences in appearance.<br>
                    Children at this age also tend to be egocentric, meaning that
                    they tend not to understand that other people see the world in
                    different ways. 
                </p>

                <h2>Concrete Operational Stage</h2>
                <p>The concrete operational stage encompasses the age range of 7-12
                    years. Piaget defined this stage to be the phase where children
                    begin to use logic to make sense of events.<br>
                    At this stage, children understand the concept of conservation.
                </p>

                <h2>Formal Operational Stage</h2>
                <p>The formal operational stage encompasses the age range of 12 years
                    and onwards. Piaget defined this stage to be the phase where
                    one can use logic to make sense of abstract concepts.<br>
                    At this stage, people have the ability to make and test 
                    hypotheses, employ trial and error, and demonstrate 
                    metacognition, introspection, and higher order thinking.
                </p>
    
                <h1>Kohlberg</h1>
                <p>Kohlberg's model outlines <b>moral development.</b>
                    The model is split into three levels, each of which 
                    is composed of two stages. There are a total of six stages. <br>
                    A criticism of Kohlberg's model is that it was only designed 
                    to model males, and Kohlberg implied that female morality was 
                    less developed. 
                </p>
                <img alt="Lawrence Kohlberg" src="https://nursing-theory.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/lawrence-kohlberg.jpg">
                <h2>Level 1: Preconventional Morality</h2>
                <p>Preconventional morality is defined by Kohlberg to be
                    the phase where judgements are made based on personal
                    consequences.
                </p>
                <h3>Stage 1: Punishment and Obedience</h3>
                <p>In this stage, decisions are made based on whether or not
                    one will be punished or rewarded for obeying or breaking 
                    rules.</p>
                <h3>Stage 2: Personal Reward</h3>
                <p>In this stage, decisions are made based on whether or not the 
                    consequences of an action are beneficial or not. Consequences 
                    outside of the rules are considered at this stage.</p>
                
                <h2>Level 2: Conventional Morality</h2>
                <p>Conventional morality is defined by Kohlberg to be
                    the phase where judgements are made based on societal 
                    consequences.
                </p>
                <h3>Stage 3: Good Child</h3>
                <p>In this stage, decisions are made based on what 
                    one thinks the impact of their decision will be on 
                    their social standing or reputation.</p>
                <h3>Stage 4: Law and Order</h3>
                <p>In this stage, decisions are made based on whether or not they 
                    obey the law. People in this stage prioritize obeying authority.</p>
                    
                <h2>Level 3: Postconventional Morality</h2>
                <p>Postconventional morality is defined by Kohlberg to be
                    the phase where judgements are made based on abstract and 
                    personal ideas of right and wrong.
                </p>
                <h3>Stage 5: Social Contract</h3>
                <p>In this stage, it is recognized that laws are not 
                    perfect arbiters of morality. Decisions are made to 
                    follow the spirit, not necessarily the letter, of the 
                    law.</p>
                <h3>Stage 6: Universal Ethical Principle</h3>
                <p>In this stage, decisions are made based on personal beliefs 
                    of right and wrong, conscience, justice, and morality.</p>
                        
                    
                <h1>Erikson</h1>
                <p>Erikson's model outlines <b>social development.</b> 
                    Erickson believed that each person's personality goes through 
                    the same stages centered around a distinct conflict. 
                    Erickson's model is split into eight stages.</p>
                <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTLMEh5qHBfwiyUN6J8MwunvSw3M6uhqK9CVpICrbrBkKFifk8B">
                <h2>Trust vs. Mistrust</h2>
                <p>The conflict in this stage centers around whether or not an infant's 
                    needs are reliably met. According to Erikson, if the infant is properly 
                    cared for, they will develop <b>basic trust.</b> If not, mistrust and 
                    anxiety can develop.<br>
                    Erikson defined <b>basic trust</b> to be the belief that the 
                    world is predictable and not not prone to change.
                </p>

                <h2>Autonomy vs. Shame</h2>
                <p>The conflict in this stage centers around whether or not 
                    a toddler can successfully execute physical skills. According to 
                    Erikson, they will either develop confidence or insecurity in their 
                    abilities during this stage.
                </p>

                <h2>Initiative vs. Guilt</h2>
                <p>The conflict in this stage centers around whether or not 
                    a young child can successfully plan and initiate tasks. Similar to the 
                    previous stage, they can develop self-confidence or insecurity about 
                    their independence and ability.
                </p>

                <h2>Industry vs. Inferiority</h2>
                <p>The conflict in this stage centers around whether or not 
                    a child can apply the abilities they developed in previous 
                    stages. According to Erikson, success will fuel feelings of 
                    confidence, while failure to apply themselves can 
                    lead to feelings of inferiority and self-doubt.
                </p>

                <h2>Identity vs. Role Confusion</h2>
                <p>The conflict in this stage centers around teenagers finding 
                    their sense of self and identity. According to Erikson, this 
                    is when teenagers determine who they want to be and 
                    what they want to do. If they fail to figure this out, 
                    it can lead to role confusion or an identity crisis, where 
                    people lack a sense of direction.
                </p>

                <h2>Intimacy vs. Isolation</h2>
                <p>The conflict in this stage centers around a young adult's 
                    ability to form relationships. According to Erikson, 
                    failure to form <b>intimate</b> relationships can lead 
                    to feelings of social isolation.<br>
                    Erikson defines <b>intimacy</b> to be the ability to form 
                    close, functional relationships.
                </p>

                <h2>Generativity vs. Stagnation</h2>
                <p>The conflict in this stage centers around a middle-aged 
                    adult's sense of purpose in life. Most adults have something 
                    they dedicate their lives to, such as family or work. 
                    According to Erikson, not having something to work towards 
                    can lead to a feeling of uselessness and irrelevance.
                </p>

                <h2>Integrity vs. Despair</h2>
                <p>The conflict in this stage centers around the elderly's 
                    feelings of whether or not their life had any meaning. 
                    According to Erikson, if one feels that they did not accomplish 
                    their life goals or has abundant regrets about their past, 
                    they can develop feelings of despair and hopelessness.
