                    <h3>BREAKING NEWS!</h3>
                    <h4>Toddler Learns You Can Say No!</h4>
                    <p>This just in from the Jiang household: in a shocking turn of 
                        events, David Jiang has learned that not forgiving people is 
                        an option!<br><br>

                        The Jiang siblings have always been quick to forgive each other. However, 
                        when David asked his sister to forgive him for messing up one of her toys, 
                        she is quoted as saying: <br><br>
                        "No!"<br><br>
                        We interviewed David after the incident. Unfortunately, he was too preoccupied 
                        with sobbing to respond to comment.<br>
                        A spokesperson reached out to us afterwards for comment, and is quoted as saying:<br><br>

                        "This is the first time that he's heard 'no' used as a response to a request for 
                        forgiveness. It's like his worldview is shattered; he doesn't know what to believe 
                        anymore. Who knew that was an option? If you can choose to not forgive someone, then 
                        what other things can you say 'no' to? He's taking some time to reflect and internalize 
                        this revelation - it might take up to five minutes for him to move on from this."<br><br>

                        The rest of the Jiang family declined to comment.

                <h1>Erikson's Commentary</h1>
                <p>
                    In the Trust vs. Mistrust stage, a child develops a sense of <b>basic trust</b> 
                    in response to being properly cared for. <br>
                    Once one develops <b>basic trust</b>, they come to believe that the world is trustworthy. 
                    However, in this instance, the child's <b>basic trust</b> was challenged, as something he 
                    previously took as fact - you always have to forgive someone if they ask - was revealed 
                    not to be as strictly binding as he previously believed. While not indicative of a lack 
                    of love in their relationship, transgressing on the child's trust could be seen as improper 
                    care of the child's emotional needs.
