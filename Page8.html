                <h1>Excerpt</h1>
                <h3>Age: 16+</h3>
                <p>
                    According to He et al., (2019), a higher humidity meant higher rates of particle agglomeration.<br>
                    Higher particle agglomeration meant more particle agglomeration meant bigger particles.<br><br>
                    According to Lowther et al., (2020), particles in the 200-300nm range were least effectively filtered.<br>
                    According to Byrley et al., (2021), and Alberts et al., (2019), and Gu et al., (2019), and... 
                    well, the point is, higher humidity means bigger particles in the 200-300nm range which means less 
                    effective filtration.<br><br>

                    Hypothesis: Higher humidity leads to less effective filtration of emissions from 3D printing.<br><br>

                    So, assuming I had all the facts right, when I turned on this 3D printer in proximity to a dehumidifier, 
                    the particles would be smaller than usual, be more effectively filtered, and therefore there would be more of them 
                    captured on this filter I had here. Then, when I looked at it under Scanning Electron Microscopy, I would see more of them, 
                    and they would be smaller.<br><br>

                    Easy as pie. And it only took me 21 articles to figure it out.<br><br>

                    Observation: I can't see anything under SEM.<br>
                    And, my apparatus broke.<br>
                    And, this new article says that I was wrong about this one thing from before I could've sworn was fact.<br>
                    And, this shipment of whatever I need to fix my project got delayed.<br><br>

                    Flash forward, and I've fixed those four issues?<br>
                    Bad news is, I have five more.

                    The Formal Operational Stage is where you're capable of trial and error? Please tell me there's a stage 
                    above this where you're too smart for the "error" part, and then please tell me how to get there.

                    In the Formal Operational Stage, one can use logic to form hypotheses, demonstrate higher order thinking, and 
                    make use of trial and error. The act of conducting a research project is indicative of the ability to form a hypothesis; 
                    the investigation of the hypothesis is indicative of an ability to make use of trial and error, as the issues 
                    faced by the adolescent in the excerpt were solved via trial and error.<br>
                    The use of metacognition at this stage is also apparent, given that said adolescent is analyzing his own thought process 
                    by describing his development at this stage of life.
