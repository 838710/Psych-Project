                <h1>Excerpt</h1>
                <h3>Age: 14</h3>
                From: Brother's Perspective
                <p>
                    "Oh come on, just get in there."<br><br>

                    I was getting impatient. I'd dragged him all this way, just for him to get cold feet now? 
                    This kid.<br><br>

                    "Hey, it says that only 16 and older are allowed in here." David pointed to the sign on the gym door, 
                    finger tracing the bold letters.<br><br>

                    "You need the exercise." I gestured in return to his stick-thin body, barely thicker than the bold font on the 
                    gym door. "Besides, they won't be able to tell. You're close enough, just come on. What's the worst that could 
                    happen?"<br><br>

                    He looked around frantically, as if looking for <i>another</i> excuse to stay behind. But eventually, he followed 
                    me in.<br><br>

                    I greeted the clerk at the desk and told him our ages. 20 and 16. Soon enough, we were in the gym. I eyed the 
                    punching bags with glee.<br><br>

                    "Alright, start warming up. Then, we work the bag."<br><br>

                    I began shadow boxing in anticipation. But as I turned my head, I saw that my brother was nowhere to be seen. Where was he?<br>
                    Before long, I got my answer. There he was, over to me... with an employee in tow. He informed me that they'd double checked our hotel records. 
                    David wasn't allowed in the gym.<br><br>

                    Oh well, his loss. He could sit in our room alone while I had all the fun.

                <h1>Kohlberg's Commentary</h1>
                <p>
                    Teens typically operate by conventional morality, where the focus is placed on societal rules. 
                    In this case, the adolescent was in the Law and Order stage, where decisions are made based on 
                    whether or not they are legal. The adolescent neglected his own physical care and an opportunity 
                    to have fun, prioritizing the law instead.
