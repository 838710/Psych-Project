                <h1>Excerpt</h1>
                <h3>Age: 12</h3>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was five, I dreamed of being a programmer.<br><br>

                    Now that I was actually doing it, it was... a lot less glamorous than I'd imagined.<br><br>

                    It was satisfying to see things just work. To see that hours of debugging had 
                    paid off, and that I had a finished product.<br>
                    But looking at the finished product... it wasn't what I had wanted.<br>
                    Originally I had gotten into programming because I'd wanted to make my own games. 
                    And here I was, doing just that.<br><br>
                    Making games.<br>
                    With block code.<br>
                    And terrible physics.<br>
                    And terrible artwork.<br>
                    And a decent gameplay loop, which had gotten old after I'd played through the game 
                    for the millionth time trying to see if this minute change had fixed that one game 
                    breaking bug.<br><br>

                    It didn't feel as magical as I'd hoped. So I began to wonder... was this really for me? 
                    Is this what I wanted to do with my life?<br>
                    I'd better figure out soon. All my parents were telling me was to go out there and 
                    get some extracurriculars so I could apply to the Academy of Science - and if I wanted to 
                    get into Computer Science, I'd better make sure that my extracurriculars fit the bill.<br><br>

                    But for now, one thing at a time. One bug at a time. For the millionth time.<br>

                <p>
                    In the stage of Identity vs. Role Confusion, adolescents determine their <b>identity</b> and sense of self. 
                    In this example, the adolescent is determining his <b>identity</b>; both his <b>self-identity</b> and his <b>social identity</b>. 
                    In determining where he wants to go in life, he is forging his own sense of self, which will make him more prone to 
                    joining certain groups and thus shaping his <b>social identity</b>.<br>
                    The excerpt showcases a minor identity crisis, as the adolescent is unsure of if this 
                    is truly the identity he wants. However, for the most part, the adolescent has decided his <b>identity</b> and 
                    is not prone to much role confusion.
